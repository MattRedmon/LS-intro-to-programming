exercise #11 - "Look at several Ruby online API sources and
                 say which one you like best."

RESPONSE:
The http://ruby-doc.org/ website is the only one that I'm familiar with.  I've
used it several times and find the info it provides to be useful. I've yet to find
another single site that has as much info as this one. However, I often find better
info by doing an internet search for the individual topics I need specific
information on.
