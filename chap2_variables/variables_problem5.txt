What does x print in the following code???:

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end

puts x

ANSWER: x ends up being 3
x is initially set to 0
then the block runs 3 times incrementing x each times
leaving x = 3 at the end of the script




y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

ANSWER: You will get an error on the above code.
the variable x is declared inside the block and is
not visible outside of the block where we are trying to print it
the do/end block creates a new scope and any variables declared inside
that block are not visible outside the block unless we explicitly return
those values.
