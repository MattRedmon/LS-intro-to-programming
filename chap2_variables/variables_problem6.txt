what does the following message tell us????:

NameError: undefined local variable or method `shoes' for main:Object
  from (irb):3
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'


  ANSWER:
  the program is unable to find the variable/method named shoes.  either it
  was never created or is in a scope (such as one that is created by a block)
  and is not visible outside of that scope.
