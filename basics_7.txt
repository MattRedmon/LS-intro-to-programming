What does the following error message tell you????


SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'


  ANSWER: There is an unexpected parenthesis and curly brace.  There is an opening
  bracket somewhere in the program without the expected closing brace
