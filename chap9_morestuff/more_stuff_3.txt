exercise # 3 -- What is exception handling and what problem does it solve??

ANSWER:
Exception handling allows us to deal with error and unexpected results in a
manageable and predictable way.  We can use the exception class allow us to program
responses to deal with these errors without breaking the program.  We use the
begin, rescue, end trio to allows errors to be caught, a response to the error to
be returned to us, and then allows the program to continue on without interruption.
Without these the error would cause the program to halt.
